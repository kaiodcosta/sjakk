# Official Sjakk Open Source Project

*November 1, 2019*

Sjakk is a chess interface for freechess.org, known as FICS (and chessclub.com
[TODO]).  Although there are several fine chess interfaces available, almost all
of them seem to have stopped active development.  My vision for Sjakk is to be
a simple interface with minimum features required to comfortably  play chess 
and the popular variants such as: fischer random, suicide, bughouse, etc.

# The Sjakk Project

Sjakk is coded in C++ using the Qt 5 Framework in the hopes of becoming cross-platform
compatible.  Currently, only Windows version is available, but due to the nature
of the Qt Framework, it should be easy in the future to support Linux, Mac, 
Android, etc.

Contributors are welcomed.

## Releases

The current released version is alpha level, this is the first release.  *Alpha* means
that it has bugs, and definately has missing features.  It is not feature complete.
Aside from that, it is suprisingly playable, that is, no major gotcha bugs yet.
But if you are concerned about your rating, then use it for non-rated games.
