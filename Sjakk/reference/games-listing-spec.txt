games

Usage: games [#, string, /[bBelLsSuwxz]]

The games command is used for listing games currently being played on the
server. The games are listed in order of the ratings of the players involved.

PARAMETERS
----------

There are four possible ways in which this command can be used. Used alone,
with no parameters, all current games are listed.

#:      if a number is supplied as a parameter, only the game matching that
        number is displayed; example: "games 23" ;
string: if a string of letters (or even a single letter) is supplied, only
        games involving players whose handles begin with that string are
        displayed; for example, "games gr" will show all games involving
        players whose handles begin with "gr";
/:      if a string starting with either "/" or "-" is supplied, games of
        certain types will be displayed; valid game types are:

        b: blitz      l: lightning   u: untimed      e: examined game
        s: standard   w: wild        x: atomic       z: crazyhouse
        B: Bughouse   L: losers      S: Suicide

        for example, "games /b" will show blitz games only, while "games /we"
        will show all wild games and all examined games.
