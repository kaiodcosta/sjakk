iv_gameinfo

  Setting ivariable gameinfo provides the interface with extra notifications
when the start starts a game or simul or a game is observed.

Example output:

- <g1> 1 p=0 t=blitz r=1 u=1,1 it=5,5 i=8,8 pt=0 rt=1586E,2100  ts=1,0

  (note the - was added so as not to confuse interfaces displaying this
   helpfile)

  This is in the format:
- <g1> game_number p=private(1/0) t=type r=rated(1/0)
u=white_registered(1/0),black_registered(1/0)
it=initial_white_time,initial_black_time
i=initial_white_inc,initial_black_inc
pt=partner's_game_number(or 0 if none)
rt=white_rating(+ provshow character),black_rating(+ provshow character)
ts=white_uses_timeseal(0/1),black_uses_timeseal(0/1)

  Note any new fields will be appended to the end so the interface must be
able to handle this.
